# DAART Onboarding V3 - Progress Log

## Project Overview
Building V3 of DAART onboarding prototype with conversational builder approach based on designer Sofia's "North Star" vision.

## Critical Constraints
1. **NO EMOJIS** - Never use emojis anywhere in this project
2. **Dialtone Design System** - Must use Dialtone components and styles
3. **Lo-fi approach** - Keep simple until full Dialtone integration

## Technology Stack
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Vite
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router
- Dialtone CSS (no Vue components yet due to Vue 2/3 compatibility issues)
- Dialtone MCP Server (installed and configured)

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Setup (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created V3 repo at `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3`
- ✅ Installed dependencies: Vue 3, Vite, Pinia, Vue Router, Dialtone packages
- ✅ Set up basic project structure with views, components, router, stores
- ✅ Configured Vite (port 5174)
- ✅ Created fallback CSS for Dialtone classes
- ✅ Set up routing for three main views:
  - `/` - StartingPointView
  - `/builder` - ConversationalBuilderView (not built yet)
  - `/agent/:id/overview` - AgentOverviewView (not built yet)

### Starting Point View (COMPLETED)
Built and styled to match reference design (`home.png`):
- Hero section with "AI Agents" heading
- Prompt input section with:
  - Large textarea (4 rows) for user goal input
  - "Improve" button (text only, no emoji)
  - "Start Building" primary button
- Suggested goals section:
  - 6 healthcare-related goal cards in 3-column grid
  - Each card has badge (info/success/default), title, description
  - Cards are clickable and pre-fill the textarea
- Help section:
  - 3 placeholder cards (Video demo, Case study, Video guide)
  - Gray background placeholders

**Key Styling Details:**
- Light gray background (#fafafa)
- Black heading (not purple)
- Generous vertical spacing (80px padding, 64px margins)
- 16px margin between text and card grids
- 3-column responsive grid
- Clean, minimal lo-fi aesthetic

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Dialtone-Vue Removed**: Encountered Vue 2/3 compatibility issues, switched to CSS-only approach
2. **Fallback CSS Created**: Built `dialtone-fallback.css` with essential utility classes as backup
3. **No Emojis Rule**: Strictly enforced throughout the project
4. **Component-Scoped Styles**: Avoided Dialtone utility classes where they conflict with component CSS

### Files Modified/Created
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/src/views/StartingPointView.vue` - Main landing page
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/src/assets/styles/main.css` - Base styles with fallback tokens
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/src/assets/styles/dialtone-fallback.css` - Fallback Dialtone classes
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/src/main.js` - App initialization with CSS imports
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/src/router/index.js` - Route configuration
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-v3/package.json` - Dependencies

### Dialtone MCP Server (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Installed globally: `npm install -g @dialpad/dialtone-mcp-server`
- ✅ Added to Claude config: `claude mcp add dialtone --scope user dialtone-mcp-server`
- ✅ Verified working: Successfully queried components, tokens, utility classes, and icons
- ✅ Used to apply proper Dialtone design tokens to prototype

### Dialtone Design System Integration (COMPLETED - Nov 20, 2025)
Replaced all hardcoded styles with proper Dialtone design tokens using MCP server:

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Queried Dialtone MCP for design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, borders)
- ✅ Replaced ~50+ hardcoded values with Dialtone CSS custom properties
- ✅ Updated StartingPointView.vue with proper token usage
- ✅ Updated main.css to use Dialtone tokens
- ✅ Fixed CSS imports: Added both base CSS and default theme CSS

**Key Changes:**
- Colors: `#fafafa` → `var(--dt-color-surface-secondary)`, `#fff` → `var(--dt-color-surface-primary)`, etc.
- Spacing: `80px` → `var(--dt-space-700)`, `24px` → `var(--dt-space-550)`, etc.
- Borders: `8px` → `var(--dt-size-radius-400)`, `1px solid #e5e5e5` → `1px solid var(--dt-color-border-subtle)`
- Typography: Added `var(--dt-font-family-sans)`, `var(--dt-font-size-*)`, `var(--dt-font-weight-*)`
- Shadows: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` → `var(--dt-shadow-200)`

**CSS Import Fix:**
```javascript
// src/main.js - Must import BOTH base and theme CSS
import '@dialpad/dialtone/css'              // Base styles
import '@dialpad/dialtone/css-default-theme' // Theme tokens (required!)
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic theme support (light/dark mode, brand variants)
- Consistent spacing and colors across the app
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Design system compliance

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Conversational Builder View (NEXT)
Build the main chat interface where users build their AI agent:
- Chat layout with message history
- User message input
- AI assistant responses
- Milestone tracker sidebar (3-column layout from design)
- Step-by-step conversation flow
- "Do everything" vs "Step-by-step" mode selection

### Phase 3: Builder Logic
- State management for conversation
- Milestone tracking
- Tool connection flows
- Validation requirements

### Phase 4: Post-Build Flow
- Test mode integration
- Agent overview page
- Deployment options

### Conversational Builder (COMPLETED - Nov 21, 2025)
Built the complete conversational agent builder with both beginner and pro-user paths.

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Created Pinia stores for conversation and agent state management
- ✅ Built ConversationalBuilderView with chat layout and milestone sidebar
- ✅ Created ChatMessage, MessageInput, and MilestoneTracker components
- ✅ Implemented complete 6-phase flow for both paths
- ✅ Fixed font sizes to use proper Dialtone scale (15px base, 19px headers)
- ✅ Simplified conversation flow to avoid overwhelming users
- ✅ Added action buttons for key choices (no typing required)

**Beginner Path (Step-by-step):**
- Phase 1: Agent Foundation - 5 questions about appointments
- Phase 2: Tool Connections - Calendar and video service selection
- Phase 3: Safety & Guardrails - Identity verification and business rules
- Phase 4: Validation - Shows improvements and applies them
- Phase 5: Optional Skills - Add confirmations, reminders, or skip
- Phase 6: Test & Launch - Start testing or save demo link

**Pro-User Path (Run whole plan):**
- Accepts document paste or quick answers
- Faster flow through all 6 phases
- Combined tool selection (Google Calendar + Zoom or Microsoft + Teams)
- Auto-skips optional skills phase
- Same validation and testing as beginner

**Key Features:**
- State machine manages conversation flow
- Milestone tracker updates automatically at each phase
- Messages appear gradually with natural timing
- Action buttons reduce typing friction
- Both paths fully functional end-to-end

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/src/stores/conversation.js` - Conversation state management
- `/src/stores/agent.js` - Agent configuration storage
- `/src/views/ConversationalBuilderView.vue` - Main chat interface (550+ lines)
- `/src/components/builder/ChatMessage.vue` - Message bubbles with actions
- `/src/components/builder/MessageInput.vue` - Text input with Improve/Send
- `/src/components/builder/MilestoneTracker.vue` - Progress sidebar

## Context Import from V2 Prototype (Nov 21, 2025)
Imported extensive context and learnings from the V2 workspace-based prototype:

**What Was Imported:**
- ✅ Created `CONTEXT_FROM_V2.md` - Comprehensive 600+ line context document
- ✅ Design patterns and component architecture from V2
- ✅ User flow comparisons (V2 workspace vs V3 conversational)
- ✅ Known issues and lessons learned
- ✅ Reusable components identified (TestingPanel, patterns)
- ✅ State management patterns
- ✅ Dialtone integration approach validated

**Key Insights Applied:**
- V3's conversational approach is significantly faster (2-5 min vs 5-10 min to value)
- Progressive disclosure pattern (beginner vs pro paths) validated by V2 experience
- Milestone tracker solves V2's "scroll back through history" problem
- Inline actions eliminate V2's tab-switching friction

**V2 Repo Location:** `/Users/amitayre/code/daart-onboarding-prototype`

## Intercom Fin UX Research (Nov 21, 2025)
Researched Intercom Fin agent setup flow to understand best practices for AI agent onboarding:

**What Was Learned:**
- ✅ Fin uses structured Train → Test → Deploy → Analyze workflow
- ✅ Each section has sub-sections (Content, Guidance, Tasks under Train)
- ✅ Live preview panel always visible on right side
- ✅ Batch testing interface with "Good/Poor" rating system
- ✅ 10-step deploy wizard with audience selection, channel selection, and preview
- ✅ Progressive disclosure - show only what's needed when needed
- ✅ Expandable cards for detailed information
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for progress and completion

**Key Patterns to Apply:**
- Use expandable cards (Dialtone accordion) for validation improvements
- Add live preview panel showing agent config in real-time
- Show loading/progress states for AI processing (pro path)
- Inline input cards for connection naming
- Split-view testing interface
- Professional dashboard for post-deploy overview

**Important Clarification:**
- ✅ Keep conversational builder (core differentiator from Intercom)
- ✅ Keep "for context.pdf" design vision
- ✅ Use Intercom patterns for UX polish only, not architecture
- ✅ Focus on completing missing pieces with professional UX

## Current Status (Nov 21, 2025)

### What's Working Well
- ✅ Full conversational builder with beginner and pro paths
- ✅ All 6 phases implemented end-to-end
- ✅ State machine managing conversation flow
- ✅ Dialtone design tokens properly applied
- ✅ Action buttons reduce typing friction
- ✅ Auto-scrolling and natural message timing

## Session 2: Deployment State Persistence (November 21, 2025)

### Problem Identified
User reported: "Deploy your agent has some issue. After deploying when i come back to the page, it shows not deployed & I dont see the 'Deployment Details'"

**Root Cause:** Deployment state was stored in local component refs (`deploymentStatus`, `selectedChannel`, `config`, `deployedAt`) in DeployView.vue. When navigating away and returning, the component remounted and reset all state to defaults.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Agent Store Enhancement
**File:** `src/stores/agent.js`

Added deployment section to state:
```javascript
deployment: {
  channel: null, // 'chat' | 'email' | 'phone' | 'slack'
  deployedAt: null,
  config: {
    greetingMessage: "Hi! I'm your AI assistant. How can I help you today?",
    workingHours: '24/7',
    fallbackBehavior: 'escalate',
    escalationThreshold: '2'
  }
}
```

Added three new actions:
- `deployAgent(channel, config)` - Saves deployment, sets status to 'deployed', marks onboarding complete
- `updateDeploymentConfig(config)` - Updates config for live agents
- `unpublishAgent()` - Removes deployment, sets status back to 'ready'

#### 2. DeployView Persistence
**File:** `src/views/DeployView.vue`

Added `onMounted` hook to load state from store:
```javascript
onMounted(() => {
  if (agentStore.deployment.channel) {
    // Agent is deployed, load the deployment info
    selectedChannel.value = agentStore.deployment.channel
    deployedAt.value = agentStore.deployment.deployedAt
    config.value = { ...agentStore.deployment.config }
    deploymentStatus.value = 'live'
  }
})
```

Updated `confirmDeploy()` to persist to store:
```javascript
const confirmDeploy = () => {
  // Deploy agent in store (persists deployment info)
  agentStore.deployAgent(selectedChannel.value, config.value)
  
  // Update local state
  deploymentStatus.value = 'live'
  deployedAt.value = agentStore.deployment.deployedAt
  
  // Celebrate!
  setTimeout(() => {
    alert('Congratulations! Your agent is now live and ready to help customers.')
  }, 300)
}
```

Updated `handleUnpublish()` to use store:
```javascript
const handleUnpublish = () => {
  if (confirm('Are you sure you want to unpublish your agent?...')) {
    agentStore.unpublishAgent()
    deploymentStatus.value = 'draft'
    deployedAt.value = null
    selectedChannel.value = null
  }
}
```

### Testing & Verification
- Deployed agent with "Chat Widget" channel
- Navigated to Overview, Test, Monitor pages
- Returned to Deploy page - correctly showed:
  - "Live" status badge
  - "Your Agent is Live!" success message
  - "Deployment Details" card with channel, timestamp, greeting, and status
  - All action buttons (View Performance, Test Agent, Update Configuration, Unpublish)

### Deployment to GitHub Pages
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix deployment state persistence"
git push origin main
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d dist
```

**Live Demo:** https://amitdialpad.github.io/daart-onboarding-v3/

### Technical Notes
- Pinia store provides reactive state persistence across component lifecycle
- Store state survives navigation but NOT page refresh (browser refresh clears Pinia state)
- For production, would need localStorage/sessionStorage or backend persistence
- Current solution is sufficient for prototype UX validation

### Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Deployment state now persists across navigation

---
